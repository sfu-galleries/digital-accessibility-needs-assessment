<h1>SFU Galleries Digital Needs Assessment, 2023 - readme </h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<a name="readme-about"></a>

<p>In 2023, SFU Galleries engaged an external consultant to review their digital landscape and processes. The goal was to identify risks and opportunities for growth and community engagement. This assessment focuses on inclusion and accessibility. This work is ongoing. It will constantly shift as technology develops and SFU Galleries' audience changes and grows. This report responds to this particular moment (2023) to provide insight into the largest and most pressing barriers present in existing processes. It does not critique those currently engaged in this work nor those who created it. This report is written from an outside perspective. It highlights opportunities for change and identifies barriers that may not be possible to remove with the available resources to SFU Galleries. The knowledge gained from this report is equally important as solving conflicts or crossing items off a list. When we are made aware of barriers, we better understand those struggling. We can have more informed conversations and moments for inclusion, even when the temptation is to "fix" a problem and check it off a list.</p>
